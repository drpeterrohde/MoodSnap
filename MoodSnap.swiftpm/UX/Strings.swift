let help_how_to_use_moodsnap_string = "MoodSnap records your mood history by taking _MoodSnaps_, a single sheet questionaire about your mood levels, symptoms and activities.\n\nFor the statistical tools to work correctly it is best to take MoodSnaps on a regular basis. For example at the same time every evening. You can enable reminders for this within the app.\n\nWhen taking a MoodSnap your entries should reflect the _maximum_ respective degrees experienced _since the most recent_ MoodSnap and _within the last 24 hours_.\n\nFor people with mood disorders it is recommended taking additional MoodSnaps anytime you become aware of significant changes in mood levels or symptoms, as this additional data benefits analysis. There aren't any limits on how often you take MoodSnaps.\n\nFurther details can be found on the MoodSnap homepage: [www.moodsnap.app](https://www.moodsnap.app)"

let help_taking_moodsnaps_string = "The sliders at the top of the _Take MoodSnap_ window snap to five increments, ranging from _none_ to _extreme_. The toggle buttons below allow you to specify symptoms you've experience and activites you've undertaken in the same period."

let help_events_string = "_Events_ are any major life changes that you might want to look back upon as a point of reference when looking at your mood history. These could include changes in jobs, relationships, place of residence, lifestyle changes, family situations, or changes in medication or treatment.\n\nIn the _statistics_ page events can be chosen as points of reference for comparing mood history before and after the event. It is recommended to keep event titles very concise, a few words at most, putting further details into the associated notes field."

let help_notes_string = "Timestamped notes are for jotting down anything at all. It could be a quick note about something important that affected your mood at the time, or you could even use it to keep a diary. Voice dictation is a handy way of quickly taking notes here."

let photo_diary_string = "Sometimes words just aren't enough, especially when it comes to emotions. You can also take photos from within the app that get saved into your MoodSnap history as a photo diary."

let help_settings_string = "Here you can set reminders to receive notifications to keep MoodSnapping at regular times, customise the user interface, and import and export backups of your data. You can also toggle the visibility of items in the symptoms and activities lists. Since not all available items are relevant or of interest to everyone, this can help declutter the interface to focus on what's relevant to you. Hiding items does not delete any recorded data."

let statistics_intro_string = "The _statistics_ tab provides a number of graphs that visualise your mood history and several statistical indicators that can be helpful in understanding how different activites and life events affect your mood.\n\nThe example graphics below all correspond to the same data."

let statistics_mood_history_string = "The _mood history_ plot presents the four mood indicators as bar charts in units of days."

let statistics_moving_average_string = "The _moving average_ plot shows a sliding window moving average of the same four indicators, which shows trends over time."

let statistics_volatility_string_1 = "People with conditions such as bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder often experience highly volatile moods which they aim to stabilise. The _volatility_ plots visualise this as a sliding window standard deviation for each of the four mood indicators. When a mood level remains constant within the window, the volatility is zero. If it oscillates within the window the volatility measure increases."

let statistics_volatility_string_2 = "Note how the increase in volatility of depression corresponds to the sudden major change in the depression level, and the increased volatility of elevation is associated with oscillations in the elevation level."

let influences_string = "The _influences_ table provides numerical correlations showing the extent to which both mood levels and their associated volatility levels change following different activities. The number reflects the difference in the average respective level after an activity compared to before."

let statistics_butterfly_average_string_1 = "The _butterfly average_ plot is centered around a particular event or type of activity, showing the mood trend going backwards and forward in time around that point. The value is calculated as a window average from the centre point to the time shown on the axis. This provides an indication of what the mood trends are going into and coming out of different activities or events over different timescales.\n\nThe dropdown menu underneath the plot allows you to specify which activity type or event to center around.\n\nTwo separate butterfly charts are provided, one based on mood levels, the other on the respective volatility levels."

let statistics_butterfly_average_string_2 = "The example above is centered around the event of changing job, indicating that depression levels rapidly decreased following the change and gradually increased over time.\n\nThe butterfly plot captures the same information as the _influences_ table, but allows you to see those values over different timescales."

let average_mood_string = "The average mood panel displays your recent average mood levels over the specified time period."

let emergency_string = "If you feel unsafe or at risk of harm:\n\n • Call a friend, family member, your doctor, or someone you trust.\n • Call your local emergency service or helpline.\n\nA list of international helpline and emergency numbers can be found [here](https://www.opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines)."
