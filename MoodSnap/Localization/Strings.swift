let notes_on_interpretation_string_2 = "• All insights are univariate measures that correlate moods with single parameters. In reality such correlations are more accurately describe via multi-variate analysis. This can lead to misleading conclusions about cause and effect when multiple correlations are at play. For example, if elevated mood correlates with increased sleep, and increased sleep correlated with exercise, it is impossible to determine whether the underlying causality was between mood and sleep or mood and exercise.\n"
let notes_on_interpretation_string_3 = "• Correlation does not imply causality. Taking transients as an example, it is not possible to differentiate whether a mood trend was caused by a correlated activity or caused the correlated activity. The transient plots are therefore in a time-symmetric manner — the positive and negative values relative to the point of reference are symmetrically defined as the average between the reference point and the time offset on the horizontal axis. For example, a correlation between increased appetite and elevated mood could equally suggest that:\n"
