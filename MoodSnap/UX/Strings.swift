let help_how_to_use_moodsnap_string = "MoodSnap records your mood history by taking _MoodSnaps_, a single sheet questionaire about your mood levels, symptoms and activities.\n\nFor the analytics tools to work correctly it is best to take MoodSnaps on a regular basis, for example at the same time every evening. You can enable reminders for this in the _settings_ page.\n\nWhen taking a MoodSnap your entries should reflect the _maximum_ respective degrees experienced _since the most recent_ MoodSnap and _within the last 24 hours_.\n\nFor people with mood disorders it is recommended taking additional MoodSnaps anytime you become aware of significant changes in mood levels or symptoms, as this additional data benefits analysis. There aren't any limits on how often you take MoodSnaps.\n\nFurther details can be found on the MoodSnap homepage: [www.moodsnap.app](https://www.moodsnap.app)"

let help_taking_moodsnaps_string = "The sliders at the top of the _MoodSnap_ panel snap to five increments, ranging from _none_ to _extreme_. The toggle buttons below allow you to specify symptoms you've experience and activites you've undertaken in the same period. Since many of these aren't relevant to everyone, you can toggle their visibility in the settings page."

let help_events_string = "_Events_ are any major life changes that you might want to look back upon as points of reference in your mood history. These could include changes in jobs, relationships, place of residence, lifestyle changes, family situations, or changes in medication, treatment or health.\n\nIn the _statistics_ page these can be chosen as focus points for comparing mood history before and after the event. It is recommended to keep event titles very concise, a few words at most, putting further details into the associated notes field."

let help_notes_string = "Timestamped notes are for jotting down anything at all. It could be a quick note about something important that affected your mood at the time, or you could use it to keep a diary. Voice dictation is a handy way of quickly taking notes here."

let help_settings_string = "Here you can set reminders to keep MoodSnapping at regular times, customise the user interface, and import and export backups of your data. You can also toggle the visibility of items in the symptoms and activities lists. Since not all available items are relevant or of interest to everyone, this can help declutter the interface to focus on what's relevant to you. Hiding items does not delete any recorded data."

let statistics_volatility_string_1 = "People with some mood-related conditions often experience highly volatile moods which they aim to stabilise. The _volatility_ plot visualises this as a sliding standard deviation for each of the four mood indicators. When mood levels remain constant over time the volatility is zero. If they oscillate or abruptly change it increases."

let statistics_volatility_string_2 = "In the figure above, note how the increase in volatility of depression corresponds to the sudden major change in the mood history's depression level, and the increased volatility of elevation is associated with bigger oscillations in the elevation level."

let influences_string = "The _influences_ table provides numerical correlations showing the extent to which mood and volatility levels change following different activities. The number reflects the average difference between the respective levels after and before the activity. The numbers in brackets show how many times the respective activity has taken place within the specified timeframe."

let statistics_butterfly_average_string_1 = "The _butterfly average_ plot is centered around a particular event or type of activity, showing the mood trend going backwards and forward in time around that point. The value is calculated as the average between the reference point (indicated by the central vertical bar) and the time shown on the axis.\n\nThe dropdown menu below the plot allows you to specify which activity type or event to center around."

let statistics_butterfly_average_string_2 = "The example above is centered around the event of changing job, indicating that depression levels rapidly decreased following the event and then gradually increased over time.\n\nThe butterfly plot captures the same information as the _influences_ values, but with a variable timescale."

let average_mood_string = "The average mood panel displays your average mood and volatility levels over the specified time period. You can adjust the displayed timescale using the tabs at the top of the page."
