In reality such correlations are more accurately describe via multi-variate analysis. This can lead to misleading conclusions about cause and effect when multiple correlations are at play. For example, if elevated mood correlates with increased sleep, and increased sleep correlated with exercise, it is impossible to determine whether the underlying causality was between mood and sleep or mood and exercise.\n• Correlation does not imply causality. Taking transients as an example, it is not possible to differentiate whether a mood trend was caused by a correlated activity or caused the correlated activity.
