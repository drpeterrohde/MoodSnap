## About

MoodSnap is a mood diary app redesigned. 100% free and open-source, made for everybody, written with features for people with mood disorders in mind.

MoodSnap is more than a mood diary. It provides advanced analytics to provide insight into what affects your mood, and how your moods change as a result of activities and life events.

Think of MoodSnap as a diary app on steroids. You can use it to keep a regular diary, a photo diary and a mood diary, elegantly presented as a familiar chronological feed.

But a mood diary shouldn’t just record what our moods are like. It should help us understand what affects them and how the activities we engage in and life events we experience influence them.

MoodSnap provides advanced analytics that over time provide insight into how our moods correlate with the events that form the life we live, a self-awareness tool like no other.

MoodSnap was developed by an academic with bipolar disorder and many years experience working as a counsellor for Lifeline, an Australian mental health and suicide hotline charity. It was written as a gift to the community, coming from the perspective of someone suffering a mood disorder, the challenges of managing life with one, and the complexities of understanding it.
